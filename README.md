# Mastermind Project - Ruby

Mastermind project from theodinproject.com.

This project helped me solidify my understanding of classes, methods, modules, and scope of variables. 

Throughout this project, I kept experimenting with different ways to go about solving a problem. Nested loops, enumerables, arrays/hashes and their respective methods (mainly any?, all?, iterables, etc.), boolean logic, and regex, are only a few of the techniques and tools that I used to complete this project. 

In future projects, I wish to further strengthen my grasp on the concepts that I have already gone over here. I also wish to learn more about multi-dimensional arrays/hashes and how to manipulate the data stored in each. 

For this project, I wish to come back and strengthen the computer opponent. As of this version, the computer algorithm benefits from the fact that it knows which colors are correct and in the correct spot. I would like to keep the position of the correct color hidden from the computer as well so that the algorithm would truly have to keep parsing the possibilities until it arrives at the player created code.
